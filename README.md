In our application, we considered the different design principles we learned about in lecture and in reading. 


From lecture (W2/T), we feel that we addressed many of the design principles Professor Weibel discussed.In particular, we feel that our app most storngly exhibits these principles. 

* __Visibility:__ First looking at our site, you can see the state of the device (it says "NOT CONNECTED") and possible actions. There are possible actions seen through the login Facebook and Twitter buttons.Directions for what actions to perform are also listed on the top of our applciation "Login into FB and click on any circle in the box belowed to see your status displayed here! "

* __Feedback:__ After login, our application sends information back to the user about what has been done. After login to your choice of social media, there is an immediate, synchronized feedback. The application will display "Logged in as: <Your Name>."

* __Consistency:__ Our application has an interface that uses similar elements for similar tasks. For example, the headers that divide the different aspects of our app (visualization versus status data) are both the same size type and font. Buttons for login to any social media websites are the same look and color to remain consistent throughout the page. 


In addition the design principles mentioned in lecture, we also feel that our application reflected Nielson and Molich's Design Principles as seen in the documentation.
A primary principle we feel that our app most strongly exhibits from the reading is:

* __Aesthetic and minimalist design:__ Our application maintains a constant theme throughout. We feel that it is fairly minimalist; it provides only the most relevant information to the user and has fairly little clutter.
